# boats <- c(reads_dory$vessel, reads_dloop$vessel) |> unique()
``` -->

# Intro

<!-- Background information -->
We have water samples from 

We have known the catch species that have been stored in the hold. Our aim is to estimate the probability that a species was in the hold given the number of reads in the sample. 


# Methods

<!-- Problem we need to address -->
Each sample goes through the nanopore, the total number of reads from a sample differs between samples, and within a sample there are a given number of reads for each OTU. 

## Stats

The model we are using is a mixed effects binomial regression model. 

<!-- ```{r}
library(equatiomatic)
extract_eq(dory_mod_log)
``` -->

<!-- $$
\log\left[ \frac { P( \operatorname{possible\_detection} = \operatorname{1} ) }{ 1 - P( \operatorname{possible\_detection} = \operatorname{1} ) } \right] = \alpha + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{reads\_\log})
$$

```{r dory-mod, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
